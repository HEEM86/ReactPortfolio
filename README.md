## Portfolio Update :heavy_exclamation_mark:

The portfolio page has links to all of the projects, I've completed so far. Also, I have a link to my LinkedIN profile, that's been updated with my FullStack BootCamp experience.

## Conslusion :boom:

Looking at the Old Site vs the New Site, I'm shocked that I was able to pull this off. Honestly, going in I felt a bit uncomfortable, and didn't imagine I would get it to visually look close to the examples. Persistance and reaching out for help, was key. I wasted so much time trying to figure things out on my own, which isn't a bad thing but it always good to get someone else's perspective. Moving forward I'm feeling good but humble, this assignment was "eye-opener" for me to focus more and apply myself.
